My aim here is to make available my character controller for my game Raigon.

Currently, this addon does not work. I am actively working to make it so it does, so stay tuned for that update.

## Installation:
Clone this repo into the `addons` folder of your project recursively:

```
git clone https://github.com/BradGaddis/godot-on-rails-third-person-shooter-character-controller rails_character_controler --recursive
```

## Usage:
You will need to restart your project after enabling this plugin.

TBD
